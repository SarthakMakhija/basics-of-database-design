- Check the byte array size in KeyValuePair (NA)
- Error handling
- Ensure all file descriptors are closed
- Handle hardcoded memory mapped file size (done)
- How to avoid using write system call to write to a memory mapped file (done)
- Store test for file lock
- Ensure that entries written to the key/value log file are actually persisted on the physical media (fsync)
- See if we need fadvice
- CRC in log entries
- Probably missing abstractions like SerializedKeyValue, MemoryMappedFile
- KeyValuePair should provide behavior to return key/value as strings (done)
- KeyValuePair should provide contentEquals (done)
